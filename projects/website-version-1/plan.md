- Site layout with responsive header and footer
- Page shells for all routes (/, /blog, /contact, /privacy, /terms)
- SEO utilities (metadata helpers, robots.txt, sitemap skeleton)
- Global styling foundation and Tailwind configuration

- Blog post page with MDX rendering and typography
- Per-post SEO: OpenGraph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD BlogPosting schema
- RSS feed at `/why-spaarke/rss.xml`

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SWA Next.js feature constraints | Keep code portable; fall back to App Service if needed |
| Spam on contact form | Honeypot + rate limiting; add CAPTCHA only if needed |
| Email deliverability | Use SendGrid with domain auth; persist first, email second |
| Lighthouse performance with video | Lazy load video; use poster image; defer loading |
| MDX build complexity | Use well-supported libraries (next-mdx-remote or similar) |
